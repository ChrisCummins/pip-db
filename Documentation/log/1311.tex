\subsection{Saturday 2nd}
Read about ionicons, which are a useful set of MIT licensed icons that will be
useful when designing the UI \cite{Sperry2013}.

\subsection{Sunday 3rd}
Began work on implementing static page designs based on D1 mockups, using
Bootstrap.

\textbf{TODO}
\begin{itemize}
\item Homepage - DONE
\item Advanced Search - DONE
\item Search results
\item Details page
\item Login page
\item Add data
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Monday 4th}
Incorporated Bootstrap Less CSS sources directly into project repository so that
I can hack deeply on the frontend framework rather than just monkey-patch it.

\subsection{Tuesday 5th}
Completed basic sketches for all page mockups. Next task is to tidy up the
stylesheets and incorporate it better into the Boostrap sources.
