# Version Numbering

Pip-db uses threes component version numbers, in the form **"A.B.C"**, where the
number **A** denotes the major website version, the number **B** denotes the
minor revision of the website, and the number **C** indicates the micro revision
of the website.

The version number is declared in the `configure.ac` script, and should be
modified immediately after .
