\centredtitle{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Ian Nabney for the excellent continued
supervision and guidance, without which this project would not have
been possible. Further thanks to Darren Flower for providing the
dataset and for patiently enduring my lowly understanding of the
natural sciences. I would like to acknowledge Kate Sugden and all of
the academic staff at Aston University who I've had the pleasure of
being taught by. Special thanks to Fraser Crofts, Ben Stone, Shahzad
Mumtaz, Mahmood Jasmin, and Dan Clarke for volunteering their time to
help with usability testing.
