To produce a bioinformatics tool with real world value for researchers.\r\n3. The application should provide intuitive but powerful searching facilities.\r\n4. A user account and permissions system will be used to ensure that \r\n5. The application should provide a convenient means for a certified user to edit and upload additional data.\r\n6. The application should present information in a usable and efficient form.\r\n7. Users should be allowed to download generated results for offline use.\r\n8. Adequate security precautions should be made to minimise the risk of important data being sabotaged or stolen.\r\n9. The implementation should use a clean model view controller architecture.\r\n10. Comprehensive test coverage of the API and common use cases should be automated.\r\n11. The application should be fully functional with the provided dataset, but be scalable for much larger datasets.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
