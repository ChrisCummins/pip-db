          The Closure Compiler is a tool for making JavaScript download and run
          faster. It is a true compiler for JavaScript. Instead of compiling
          from a source language to machine code, it compiles from JavaScript to
          better JavaScript. It parses your JavaScript, analyzes it, removes
          dead code and rewrites and minimizes what's left. It also checks
          syntax, variable references, and types, and warns about common
          JavaScript pitfalls.

          HtmlCompressor is a small, fast and very easy to use Java library that
          minifies given HTML or XML source by removing extra whitespaces,
          comments and other unneeded characters without breaking the content
          structure. As a result pages become smaller in size and load faster. A
          command-line version of the compressor is also available.

          The YUI Compressor is a JavaScript compressor which, in addition to
          removing comments and white-spaces, obfuscates local variables using
          the smallest possible variable name. This obfuscation is safe, even
          when using constructs such as 'eval' or 'with' (although the
          compression is not optimal is those cases) Compared to jsmin, the
          average savings is around 20%.
